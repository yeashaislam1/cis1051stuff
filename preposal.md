# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

I'll most likely do some type of game as I'm doing. It maybe a modification of the retro Mario or even retro Donkey Kong game.  Although I don't have anything entirely finalized on what I want to do with those games, I might want to add different enemies into those games, while potentially modfying the power-ups. There can also be a change in the music that is played in the game as well. Other game ideas I have is a Car game where you're trying to get to the finish line and having to avoid various obstacles in the process. Another game I had in mind was moving a basket to collect objects that fall from the top screen while not getting hit by lightning or projectiles in the process. 

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

Plan to do it on my own

## Do you have any questions of your own?

Not at the moment. Will ask in office hours if needed.
