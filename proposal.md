# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Retro Donkey Kong Mania

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

Similar to the retro Donkey kong game but you need to assemble 3 parts to make a weapon to beat Donkey Kong.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

Some of the basic components of the game will still be the same. There will be different levels players can climb up and walk on the platform. There will be 3-5 levels and Donkey Kong will be at the top throw projectiles at the player. 
At different levels of the game there will be different components to a weapon. The player must collect all the items to create the weapon. The weapon will then be used to beat Donkey Kong to beat the game. There will be Donkey Kong and Other eneimies, such as mini monkeys, will help Donkey Kong and throw projectiles at you. The game will be executed on LOVE by using Lua as the language. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

No other courses I have a final project I can cross over with. 

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

Not collaborating with anyone else. 

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A good outcome would functional ladder climbing and Donkey Kong being able to throw projectiles.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A better outcome would be having what good outcome plus having the weapon feature being a thing. The player should be able to create the weapon. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

As stated in the above, the best outcome is having all the features of the game. This means that the player is able to climb the ladders, the platforms are working, there being 3-5 platforms to climb. Donkey Kong throws projectiles and have his minions throw projectiles as well. 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

The skills that I need for this is some problem solving skills and being able to use Lua. The new skills that I will acquire is futher learning about what I can do with Lua. I think the topics I will have to learn about is a bit more about projectiles to see if I can create a barrel. I want to create a healthbar over Donkey Kong. I want to learn more about making characters so that Donkey Kong and his minions look apart. Finally, I need to learn how to create the 3 parts of the weapon and actually make a function for the weapon.
